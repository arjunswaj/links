\chapter{Introduction}
This document provides the Software Requirement Specifications of the project. Specifically it provides the details on the functional and non functional aspects of the project.
\section{Document Purpose}
The document describes the software requirements of “Links”, version 1.0. The software requirements encapsulate the whole of the product.

\section{Product Scope}
“Links” is website offering bookmarking services with the specific requirement being that it should be deployable on a private server within an organization.

The purpose is to enable people in an organization to share bookmarks with each other.

The specific benefit delivered by “Links” is that sharing/publishing of bookmarks can be controlled at the required level of granularity.

“Links” is intended to be an extensible, modular system with an exposed API. Third parties must be able to write plugins and applications using this API.

It is envisioned to seemlessly fit into the “share” motto of the net community, be it through simple email or through popular social platforms like facebook and twitter. A trigger based action execution like that of ifttt.com augments this motto and is intended to be a part of “Links”.
